# Organigrams for/from the future

How can we visualize an economy built on solidarity, sustainability, and survival—instead of exploitation, extraction, and extinction? Given multiple interconnected crises, there is an urgent need to devise new kinds of structures that let us weave resilient relations with each other and the world we live in. Data visualization is typically used to represent what is, but rarely how things could and maybe should be.

This course takes on the challenge to visualize organizational structures that hardly exist yet, but are foreshadowed in the experimental configurations of cooperatives, projects, and initiatives. To seek inspiration we visit organizations that are committed to social-ecological transformation and operate on principles of social and environmental justice. These organizations share their experiences and offer opportunities to see innovative ways of working together, making decisions, and cultivating cooperation in critical times.

## Kick-off

This is a nomadic course about the visualization of organizational structures utilizing narration and exploration to encourage reflection and imagination about work and the economy.


> It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.

> It is hard to say what today's dreams are; it seems they have been downgraded to hopes—hope that we will not allow ourselves to become extinct, hope that we can feed the starving, hope that there will be room for us all on this tiny planet. There are no more visions. We don't know how to fix the planet and ensure our survival. We are just hopeful.

> That is the fundamental nature of gifts: they move, and their value increases with their passage. The fields made a gift of berries to us and we made a gift of them to our father. The more something is shared, the greater its value becomes. This is hard to grasp for societies steeped in notions of private property, where others are, by definition, excluded from sharing. Practices such as posting land against trespass, for example, are expected and accepted in a property economy but are unacceptable in an economy where land is seen as a gift to all.

> From the viewpoint of a private property economy, the “gift” is deemed to be “free” because we obtain it free of charge, at no cost. But in the gift economy, gifts are not free. The essence of the gift is that it creates a set of relationships. The currency of a gift economy is, at its root, reciprocity. In Western thinking, private land is understood to be a “bundle of rights,” whereas in a gift economy property has a “bundle of responsibilities” attached.

### Guiding research questions

- How can we translate observations about innovative organizational structures and work processes into coherent data visualizations?
- What are approaches that let us integrate social, aesthetic, and technical aspects into intriguing and informative representations?
- Is it possible to account for complex issues in a comprehensible data visualization that does justice to the social and ecological challenges?

Journal of Architectural Education, 67(2):224–233, 2013.

> Utopian visions and diagrams have engaged in a multitude of relationships. For example, a utopian narrative can be conceived as a diagram, or with the aid of diagrams, and understood through diagrammatic (re) annotation. This notion is explored through an interpretation of Thom- as More’s Utopia and Andrea Branzi’s Agronica. Both schemes address various structural conditions through diagrammatic operations. In More’s scheme the channel that separates Utopia from the mainland, dug by its putative founder King Abraxas, inscribes a circular boundary, reiterated in the city walls and moat; it is resonant with contempora- neous rota and volvelle schemata. Conversely, Andrea Branzi’s “mirror simulator” multiplies Agronica’s centrifugal grid to infinity, negating the “outside,” and is evocative of pervasive virtual networks.

> Rochdale, England, is known by millions for one reason: a handful of labourers established a co-operative there in 1844 known as the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers. That co-operative was adopted as the inspiration and model for a movement that now includes nearly 700 million people around the world. As this paper is being written, co-operators around the world are preparing to celebrate the 150th anniversary of its birth. But what did Rochdale mean? Why is it considered so important?"

> Among all the problems with 21st-century work — the ballooning of the low wage service sector, economic inequality, the crumbling of worker rights  — the main problem really is that there are so few realistic alternatives. What has been missing from the debate about the future of work is an approach that offers peo- ple something that they can wholeheartedly embrace. This is what this essay is about.

> Humanity’s challenge in the 21st century is to eradicate poverty and achieve prosperity for all within the means of the planet’s limited natural resources. In the run-up to Rio+20, this discussion paper presents a visual framework – shaped like a doughnut – which brings planetary boundaries together with social boundaries, creating a safe and just space between the two, in which humanity can thrive. Moving into this space demands far greater equity – within and between countries – in the use of natural resources, and far greater efficiency in transforming those resources to meet human needs.

> Designers have been moving increasingly closer to the future users of what they design and the next new thing in the changing landscape of design research has become co-designing with your users. But co-designing is actually not new at all, having taken distinctly different paths in the US and in Europe. The evolution in design research from a user-centred approach to co-designing is changing the roles of the designer, the researcher and the person formerly known as the ‘user’. The implications of this shift for the education of designers and researchers are enormous. The evolution in design research from a user-centred approach to co-designing is changing the landscape of design practice as well, creating new domains of collective creativity. It is hoped that this evolution will support a transformation toward more sustainable ways of living in the future.

[The Problem with Work: Feminism, Marxism, Antiwork Politics, and Postwork Imaginaries](https://caringlabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/the-problem-with-work_-feminism-marxism-kathi-weeks.pdf) by Kathi Weeks. Duke University Press, 2011.

>In The Problem with Work, Kathi Weeks boldly challenges the presupposition that work, or waged labor, is inherently a social and political good. While progressive political movements, including the Marxist and feminist movements, have fought for equal pay, better work conditions, and the recognition of unpaid work as a valued form of labor, even they have tended to accept work as a naturalized or inevitable activity. Weeks argues that in taking work as a given, we have “depoliticized” it, or removed it from the realm of political critique. Employment is now largely privatized, and work-based activism in the United States has atrophied. We have accepted waged work as the primary mechanism for income distribution, as an ethical obligation, and as a means of defining ourselves and others as social and political subjects. Taking up Marxist and feminist critiques, Weeks proposes a postwork society that would allow people to be productive and creative rather than relentlessly bound to the employment relation. Work, she contends, is a legitimate, even crucial, subject for political theory.

> In a seminal paper, Garrett Hardin argued in 1968 that users of a commons are caught in an inevitable process that leads to the destruction of the resources on which they depend. This article discusses new insights about such problems and the conditions most likely to favor sustainable uses of common-pool resources. Some of the most difficult challenges concern the management of large-scale resources that depend on international cooperation, such as fresh water in international basins or large marine ecosystems. Institutional diversity may be as important as biological diversity for our long-term survival.

> This article presents a history of ‘Project Cybersyn’, an early computer network developed in Chile during the socialist presidency of Salvador Allende (1970–1973) to regulate the growing social property area and manage the transition of Chile’s economy from capitalism to socialism. Under the guidance of British cybernetician Stafford Beer, often lauded as the ‘father of management cybernetics’, an interdisciplinary Chilean team designed cybernetic models of factories within the nationalised sector and created a network for the rapid transmission of economic data between the government and the factory floor. The article describes the construction of this unorthodox system, examines how its structure reflected the socialist ideology of the Allende government, and documents the contributions of this technology to the Allende administration.

 Data Feminism. [Introduction](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/11805.003.0002) by Catherine D'Ignazio & Lauren F. Klein, MIT Press, 2020.

> Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.

Posthumanities. University of Minnesota Press, 2017.

> To care can feel good, or it can feel bad. It can do good, it can oppress. But what is care? A moral obligation? A burden? A joy? Is it only human? In Matters of Care, María Puig de la Bellacasa presents a powerful challenge to conventional notions of care, exploring its significance as an ethical and political obligation for thinking in the more than human worlds of technoscience and naturecultures.

# Projects


Aiming to visualize structures of a social-ecological economy, each student carried out a small data visualization project, spanning data collection, visualization design, and iterative prototyping. 


The following visualization projects are based on the practices and principles encountered during the visits, readings, and exchanges throughout the semester. 


### Central questions

- What would you like to reveal with the organigrams you will make?
- What kind of work relations would you like to put out there for discussion?

## [CO-OP.COMM](https://fhp.incom.org/project/25346)

> Within the course, we visited different collectives, cooperatives and other company models that were on a path towards cooperativism. These structures communicate with each other in interwoven, self-determined and fluid ways. Through this unique communication, they jointly develop sustainable and subjective solutions. Communication can help transport values, ideas and benefits of collectives and cooperatives. But because of the individuality of each co-structure, explaining them is often not easy. It takes curiosity and exploration to gain an understanding. I understand this work as an attempt to visualise the complex communication structure of cooperatives and verify the hypothesis if this can function as a mirror of the complex co-operative work environment.

## [Status Growth](https://fhp.incom.org/project/25152)

> In an environment mainly consisting of hierarchically organised companies some alternative ways of organising work emerge: cooperatives. What defines their way of growing? What is their influence on traditionally organised companies? How do they affect not only working environment but also our way of thinking?

## [Flows of Non-Pecuniary Values](https://fhp.incom.org/project/25222)

> The aim of this project is to show how our capitalist world can move towards degrowth by focusing on values other than money.
One of the major problems in our society is monetary value. It is an infinite value that we place in a finite world with limited resources.
So what would happen if we did away with money?
This organigram explores the different streams of non-pecuniary value in a heterotopia.

## [Money Flow](https://vimeo.com/843699475)

> This project explores the often sensitive and under-discussed topic of financial distribution within cooperatives. Despite a common belief that "money has no value" in such settings and that resources are equally shared, this research aims to uncover the actual dynamics at play. It delves into the origins of the funds in cooperatives, the methods of allocation among members, and the final monetary compensation each member receives.

## [Values of cooperatives](https://prezi.com/view/VSVmkvg7c5UTmqBrTZkw/)

> Each everyday object the coop members use, subconsciously embody a value of the organization, this gets spread between the members as they use and share that object, helping them build the social environment the coop is shaped on.

## [Interdependency and Collaboration in a Co-operative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrMH18PGSMU)

> The goal of this data visualization project is to demonstrate the relationships, interactions and overlaps within a cooperative, taking inspiration from the intricate yet incredibly powerful interactions of human cells. The project highlights the significance of working together towards a common goal, like how human cells collaborate to ensure the body functions properly. Exploring this concept delves into the collective entity that cooperatives embody.

## Social Innovation

> The aim of my project was to try to analyse and narrate the historical and cultural value that collectives and cooperatives carry today, in 2023. I interpreted these organisations as bearers of *Social Innovation*, a concept now recognised by the European Union that indicates the construction of "new ideas: services, products or models that meet people needs, create relationships and form new collaborations". Social Innovation can be seen as a response to the enormous density of changes that have occurred since the last century, which have shaken the balance of the world in a very short space of time. In my research, I wanted to see these organisations as part of the path our society is taking in search of a new balance, and new ways of being together.

## Soupi

> Soupi is a student foodsaving project that cooks delicious, healthy soups with saved foods.
It will also be a design course, an educational program at schools and a movement that connects people and helps to reduce foodwaste.
At this point we connected with foodsources like supermarkets, people who work in foodsaving projects since years and cooked our first soups from saved vegetables.
The organigram is visualizing the process of turning the saved foods into soups from the foodsources and the non-hierarchical, democratic structure of the course that allows everyone at Soupi to bring in their own ideas and visions.
