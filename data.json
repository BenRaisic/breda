Given multiple interconnected crises, there is an urgent need to devise new kinds of structures that let us weave resilient relations with each other and the world we live in. Data visualization is typically used to represent what is, but rarely how things could and maybe should be. \n\n We will take on the challenge to visualize organizational structures that hardly exist yet, but are foreshadowed in the experimental configurations of cooperatives, projects, and initiatives. To find inspiration we will visit a range of organizations that are committed to social-ecological transformation and operate on principles of social and ecological justice. These organizations will share their experiences and offer opportunities to see innovative ways of working together, making decisions, and cultivating cooperation in critical times.\n\n  This webpage presents a selective documentation of key readings, inspiring projects, our generous hosts, and the resulting projects.",

The fields made a gift of berries to us and we made a gift of them to our father. The more something is shared, the greater its value becomes. This is hard to grasp for societies steeped in notions of private property, where others are, by definition, excluded from sharing. Practices such as posting land against trespass, for example, are expected and accepted in a property economy but are unacceptable in an economy where land is seen as a gift to all.\n\n> From the viewpoint of a private property economy, the ‚Äúgift‚Äù is deemed to be ‚Äúfree‚Äù because we obtain it free of charge, at no cost. But in the gift economy, gifts are not free. The essence of the gift is that it creates a set of relationships. The currency of a gift economy is, at its root, reciprocity. In Western thinking, private land is understood to be a ‚Äúbundle of rights,‚Äù whereas in a gift economy property has a ‚Äúbundle of responsibilities‚Äù attached.\n\nKimmerer, R. W. (2013).

Journal of Architectural Education, 67(2):224‚Äì233.\n\n> Utopian visions and diagrams have engaged in a multitude of relationships. For example, a utopian narrative can be conceived as a diagram, or with the aid of diagrams, and understood through diagrammatic (re) annotation. This notion is explored through an interpretation of Thom- as More‚Äôs Utopia and Andrea Branzi‚Äôs Agronica. Both schemes address various structural conditions through diagrammatic operations. In More‚Äôs scheme the channel that separates Utopia from the mainland, dug by its putative founder King Abraxas, inscribes a circular boundary, reiterated in the city walls and moat; it is resonant with contempora- neous rota and volvelle schemata. Conversely, Andrea Branzi‚Äôs ‚Äúmirror simulator‚Äù multiplies Agronica‚Äôs centrifugal grid to infinity, negating the ‚Äúoutside,‚Äù and is evocative of pervasive virtual networks.",

But co-designing is actually not new at all, having taken distinctly different paths in the US and in Europe. The evolution in design research from a user-centred approach to co-designing is changing the roles of the designer, the researcher and the person formerly known as the ‚Äòuser‚Äô. The implications of this shift for the education of designers and researchers are enormous. The evolution in design research from a user-centred approach to co-designing is changing the landscape of design practice as well, creating new domains of collective creativity. It is hoped that this evolution will support a transformation toward more sustainable ways of living in the future."}

Introduction chapter. Pages 1‚Äì36. Duke University Press.\n\n>In The Problem with Work, Kathi Weeks boldly challenges the presupposition that work, or waged labor, is inherently a social and political good. While progressive political movements, including the Marxist and feminist movements, have fought for equal pay, better work conditions, and the recognition of unpaid work as a valued form of labor, even they have tended to accept work as a naturalized or inevitable activity. Weeks argues that in taking work as a given, we have ‚Äúdepoliticized‚Äù it, or removed it from the realm of political critique. Employment is now largely privatized, and work-based activism in the United States has atrophied. We have accepted waged work as the primary mechanism for income distribution, as an ethical obligation, and as a means of defining ourselves and others as social and political subjects. Taking up Marxist and feminist critiques, Weeks proposes a postwork society that would allow people to be productive and creative rather than relentlessly bound to the employment relation. Work, she contends, is a legitimate, even crucial, subject for political theory."}

Some of the most difficult challenges concern the management of large-scale resources that depend on international cooperation, such as fresh water in international basins or large marine ecosystems.

Under the guidance of British cybernetician Stafford Beer, often lauded as the ‚Äòfather of management cybernetics‚Äô, an interdisciplinary Chilean team designed cybernetic models of factories within the nationalised sector and created a network for the rapid transmission of econ- omic data between the government and the factory floor.

These structures communicate with each other in interwoven, self-determined and fluid ways. Through this unique communication, they jointly develop sustainable and subjective solutions. Communication can help transport values, ideas and benefits of collectives and cooperatives. But because of the individuality of each co-structure, explaining them is often not easy. It takes curiosity and exploration to gain an understanding.
