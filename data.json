Given multiple interconnected crises, there is an urgent need to devise new kinds of structures that let us weave resilient relations with each other and the world we live in. Data visualization is typically used to represent what is, but rarely how things could and maybe should be. \n\n We will take on the challenge to visualize organizational structures that hardly exist yet, but are foreshadowed in the experimental configurations of cooperatives, projects, and initiatives. To find inspiration we will visit a range of organizations that are committed to social-ecological transformation and operate on principles of social and ecological justice. These organizations will share their experiences and offer opportunities to see innovative ways of working together, making decisions, and cultivating cooperation in critical times.\n\n  Below is a selected documentation of key readings, inspiring projects, our generous hosts, and the resulting projects.",

The visualizations will be based on practices and principles encountered during the visits, readings, and exchanges throughout the semester. While students will work individually on their projects, the entire course will form a temporary collective experimenting with some of the principles we encounter during the semester."},

			{"markdown":"*That is the fundamental nature of gifts: they move, and their value increases with their passage. The fields made a gift of berries to us and we made a gift of them to our father. The more something is shared, the greater its value becomes. This is hard to grasp for societies steeped in notions of private property, where others are, by definition, excluded from sharing. Practices such as posting land against trespass, for example, are expected and accepted in a property economy but are unacceptable in an economy where land is seen as a gift to all.*\n\n *From the viewpoint of a private property economy, the ‚Äúgift‚Äù is deemed to be ‚Äúfree‚Äù because we obtain it free of charge, at no cost. But in the gift economy, gifts are not free. The essence of the gift is that it creates a set of relationships. The currency of a gift economy is, at its root, reciprocity. In Western thinking, private land is understood to be a ‚Äúbundle of rights,‚Äù whereas in a gift economy property has a ‚Äúbundle of responsibilities‚Äù attached.*\n\nKimmerer, R. W. (2013).
